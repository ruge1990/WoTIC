WoTIC (Web of Things Interface Creation) is a toolchain of automatic generating WoT interface from extended WoT TD instances. The WoTIC will firstly take the instances of extended TD as input and create the instance of OAS by a model-to-model transformation. After that, WoTIC will take the instance of OAS as input and automatically generate and deploy the WoT interface by a model-to-code transformation. The output of WoTIC is an executable WoT interface consisting a HTTP server and a CoAP server.
